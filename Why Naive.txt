Convex    Anise       Smooth       Edible
Bell      Almond      Scaly        Edible 
Convex    Pungent     Smooth       Poisonous
Bell      None        Fibrous      Edible
Flat      None        Scaly        Poisonous
Bell      None        Smooth       Poisonous

Event A: Edible

P(Edible) = P(A) = 4/7
P(Edible | shape=Convex) = P(shape=Convex|Edible)* P(Edible)/ P(Convex)
                         = 2/4 * 4/7 /   3/7
                         = 2/7 / 3/7
                         = 2/3


P(Poisonous | shape=Convex) = P(shape=Convex|Poisonous) * P(Poisonous) / P(Convex)
                            = 1/3 * 3*7 / 3/7
                            = 1/7  / 3/7
                            = 1/3

TELL ME WHICH PROBABILITY IS HIGH (EDIBLE or POISONOUS) when
shape = CONVEX
2/3 > 1/3
(We may drop the divisor for efficiency)

So the feature "shape" contributes to category : EDIBLE

Above calculation was based on 1 feature
Say we have 2 features

P(Edible | x = (Convex, Smooth))
       is proportional to 
P(x=(Convex,Smooth) |Edible) * P(Edible) 
 (because we have dropped the divisor) 

P(x= convex |Edible)* P(x = smooth|Edible) * P(Edible)

As every feature (convex, smooth,...) is treated independently
So Bayes theorm is termed as Naive Bayes
